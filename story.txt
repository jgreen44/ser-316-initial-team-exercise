A customer walked into the post office in Berlin to mail a package.
After opening the mail the customer went and ate a Bratwurst with cheese.
While sitting with some new friends at the local bargarten, he saw his mailman being chased by a hund!
The big bad wolf likes to eat Apfelkuchen instead of the child in the red riding dress.
