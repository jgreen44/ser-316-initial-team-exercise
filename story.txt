A customer walked into the post office in Berlin to mail a package.
After opening the mail the customer went and ate a Bratwurst with cheese.
While sitting with some new friends at the local bargarten, he saw his mailman being chased by a hund!
The big bad appears! The wolf likes to eat Apfelkuchen instead of the child in the red riding dress.
The customer could tell from the wolf's lederhose that it was a noble that probably lived in a Schloss.
The wolf confronted the hund, saying that he cut him off on the haupstrasse.
Ignoring the wolf's Karening, all I could think about was that I wanted to go fishing at the Eltz.
While fishing at the Eltz , I'd invite my grandmother for some Gebaeck.
What a wonderful time it would be, oh to bask in some natural Klimaanlage!
My grandmother arrived in her BMW and brought some Brot for lunch.
Although I love her new BMW, I wish we could have taken her Porsche for one last drive to Raesfeld.
I love listening to Rammstein through the stereo system that her Porsche has.
My grandmother however, is not a big fan of Rammstein since she can't dance around in her dirndel to the music.
