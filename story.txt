A customer walked into the post office in Berlin to mail a package.
After opening the mail the customer went and ate a Bratwurst with cheese.
While sitting with some new friends at the local bargarten, he saw his mailman being chased by a hund!
The big bad appears! The wolf likes to eat Apfelkuchen instead of the child in the red riding dress.
The customer could tell from the wolf's lederhose that it was a noble that probably lived in a Schloss.
The wolf confronted the hund, saying that he cut him off on the haupstrasse.
Ignoring the wolf's Karening, all I could think about was that I wanted to go fishing at the Eltz.
While fishing at the Eltz , i'd invite my grand mother for some Gebaeck
