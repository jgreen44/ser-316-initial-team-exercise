A customer walked into the post office in Berlin to mail a package.
After opening the mail the customer went and ate a Bratwurst with cheese.
While sitting with some new friends at the local bargarten, he saw his mailman being chased by a hund!
The big bad appears! The wolf likes to eat Apfelkuchen instead of the child in the red riding dress.
This is because the child's mother worked at the Baeckerei, where she made Apfelkuchen and other Gaebecke.
