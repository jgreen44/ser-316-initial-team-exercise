aamartus:   I drove my blacked out BMW to the local Biergarten. It's right in between Berlin and the flughafen.
            They've got the best brotworst & brot. Raesfeld also has a good biergarten, but it's over 1 hour away!
            The drive isn't too bad though, and it's a straight shot on a hauptstrasse. If you  do want to get there
            quicker, consider taking a porsche there. Just remember to pack your laderhosen!
